\section*{Background}
In all, our project can be divided into a series of tasks, as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To begin, we need to actually analyze and fully understand the TMD algorithm
		as proposed by Hess et al. in terms of inputs, outputs, and time/space complexity. 
		Specifications of the inputs, outputs and the time complexity of the TMD algorithm are
		included in Hess' work, but there is no rigorous analysis of the space complexity of
		the algorithm. We've provided a rigorous statement of all of these items below.
	\item We also need to show that we can generate a discrete Morse function which can do
		an equivalent task to the filtration used in the TMD algorithm. Functionally, we 
		need to show correctness if a Morse function were used in place of the filtration.
		To do this, we need to modify the definitions inherent in a discrete Morse
		function to fit the critical cells on a neuron related to branching.
	\item We need to show that using Morse theory yields some advantages. Namely,
		we need to show that using Morse theory retains the original time complexity of the
		TMD algorithm, but using Morse theory yields savings with regards to space complexity.
	\item We also hope to show additional features that using a discrete Morse function
		allows. Specifically, we want to show that using Morse theory allows for the pinpointing
		of specific regions within a neuron, which may relate to neuron functionality.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Progress}
Thus far, we've successfully accomplished tasks 1-3. Our progress for each is loosely as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The algorithm's input, output, and runtime are clearly expressed on page 7 of Hess et al. For an analysis
		of the runtime, we claim that the space complexity of the algorithm is linear with respect to the number
		of nodes on the neuron. We prove this by considering the number of nodes in an active branch of the neuron.
		At worst, this is equivalent to the total number of nodes. As a lower bound, there could possibly be only one
		node in an active branch. But, no matter what, there must be a maximal active branch with a considerable fraction
		of the nodes. Meaning that the number of active nodes has a linear relationship to the total number of nodes, and
		the space complexity of the TMD algorithm is order of $n$.
	\item The filtration specified in the TMD algorithm essentially uses a filtration to find the persistence of branches
		throughout the neuron. To generate an equivalent Morse function, we first need to define underlying vertex data
		present in the image of a neuron. Letting $N$ denote the set of nodes in the neuron image, we define an underlying
		function $f:N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ where $f$ defines the path-based distance from a source node to any other given
		node throughout the neuron. Then, we're able to assign a modified a discrete Morse function to the complex. The function
		is modified in that critical cells are defined by any vertex which is larger than degree 2. (Because the complex is guaranteed
		to be an acyclic graph, we know that only critical vertices are possible). Then we gain matchings from a Morse function revealing
		of the flow into any critical cell in the complex. In doing so, we gain branchwise distance in the number of collapses needed to
		reach critical cells, and in doing so gain a metric of persistence in each individual branch. Thus, we gain all of the features
		given by the filtration in the TMD algorithm in using a modified Morse function.
	\item From the proposed setup, we gain that we can generate a discrete Morse function in linear time with the underlying vertex data.
		Notably, this discrete Morse function is guaranteed to be ``high performing'' in that the critical cells are guaranteed to be
		directly reflective of the areas where the neuron branches, since we guarantee that the underlying vertex data
		used by the algorithm proposed by Holmgren et al. is increasing along the path from the source to any given node, and that the function
		$f$ is injective. And, since the underlying vertex data is also guaranteed to be sorted radially along the neuron, we are able
		to improve the functionality of Holmgren et al. Indeed, the runtime in Holmgren et al. is guaranteed to remain linear with respect
		to the simplices of the neuron (i.e. roughly double the number of vertices for a graph), so the TMD algorithm has equivalent runtime.
		However, the algorithm by Holmgren et al. when adapted to a lexicographically sorted Hasse diagram of the underlying neuron
		is able to operate with constant space complexity. Improving the space complexity of the TMD algorithm.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Remaining Work}
As for the remainder of the project, we still need to work on specifying how to collapse simplices in an assigned Morse function to highlight
structural differences within different kinds of neurons. We have a rough idea of how to go about this, but need to elaborate fully on
the theory behind this process. And, we need to more formally write up our developments thus far, especially our framing of the problem
and our provided improvements with regards to its space complexity.
